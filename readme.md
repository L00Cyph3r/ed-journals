Work in progress parsing and utilities for working with journal files from Elite Dangerous, with specific emphasis on
creating structs and enums to make working with journal entries a lot easier and predictable.

## Features and plans

This is a list of some of the current features and some of the features I really want to have added before a 1.0
release.

- [x] Models for journal directory and files.
- [x] Journal reader to read entries from journal files.
- [x] Serde models for journal entries.
- [x] Parsing dynamic files like `Market.json`, `Status.json` etc.
- [x] Async variants of models, especially the `JournalReader`.
- [x] Automatic journal detection based on platform etc.
- [x] Exobiology utilities for things like predicting available species based on planet scan etc.

## Contributing

One of the best ways to contribute to this project is by contributing journal logs to the test-suite. Doing this will
allow the project to be more and more accurate. Note that this project currently only focuses on the live version of the
game, so game version 4 and up.

You can contribute journal files by following these steps:

1. Locate your journal files. On Windows they are saved at `C:\users\<your username>\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`
   On Linux it depends on a number of things. Check our this [forum post](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/solved-linux-journal-files.507750/) for more information.
2. It's probably a good idea to anonymize your logs and remove some of the personal content. You can do so by using the
   [ED logs anonymizer tool](https://rster2002.github.io/ed-log-anonymizer/). Make sure to check some of the exported
   files to ensure everything has been processed correctly.
3. Create a fork of the project and add your journal files to the `test-jounals` directory in the root of the project.
4. Create a PR and wait for it to be merged.
5. Thank you so much!
